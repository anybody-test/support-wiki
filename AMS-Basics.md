In the following screenshots some basics are explained how to use the script based AnyBody Modeling System:

If you click on the [1] AnyBody Assistant, you will get the chance get help on how to start a new model. You can load recently used files, or under [2] Demo (re)install the repository [3].

Once you have loaded a Main [2] file, you will have for most models some operations [1] available. You can also unfold the model tree, have a look at all the files that are included in this model or if the model uses projects, you can open them on the left side.

In the operations [1], there is usually under study an option to replay the model.

To open the ModelView or look at graphs, open Windows [1] and then select your choice. ChartFX is an external graph-viewer, it is relatively old and not supported anymore. It may causes problems in the latest AMS versions and will be removed soon.

You can see [1] the progress of the Model while running and see "what's going on" at [2]. If errors or warnings appear in your model, they will be visualized at [2], you can click on them to see where/what causes them and most times there will be a description of the error/warning.

If you see a AnyBody command (blue text) in the AnyScript, you can click on the command and press F1 and the AnyBody Reference Manual will open with a description of this command. In this Manual you can find a lot of help and descriptions. You can also find some demo files at the end of each description:

This Reference Manual and the Tutorials can also be found here [1]. Before you start making your own models, go through the tutorials, they are made to teach you! Usually, if you run into a problem, you'll find the answer in there!!

Another basic gimmick, if you double click on something in the ModelView, e.g. a muscle (and the model tree is open), you'll see this object in the model tree. You can see properties of this object, like Fout for a muscle, or you can on a right click on this object find the option "Locate in AnyScript" to find more details there. !!If you make changes to the BodyModel, be aware of the effects!!! All models use the same Body Folder, so all other Models are affected. Make a safety copy before.
