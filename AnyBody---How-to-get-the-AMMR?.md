The AMMR is available from three locations.


1)	Installed version: This current version of the AMMR is installed with the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) in the Program Files folder. This version is intended to serve as your body model implementation for all typical application modeling. Your models can (will by default) refer to this path.
It is not the intention that you should modify these files yourself. They will automatically be updated when you update AnyBody, and fixed issues will be corrected here as well as in the software itself. Typically, these files will be read-only due to the installation location.


2)	Demo version: AMS has a demo version of the AMMR included. The purpose of this version is that you can play with it as much as you feel like without affecting the installed version mentioned above.


3)	The home of AMMR: The home of AMMR is at www.anyscript.org. Here you can find the newest version as well as older versions. You will also find help there in the Wiki and the forum.


A Demo version of the repository that comes with the AnyBody Modeling System can be extracted by clicking on the AnyBody Assistant in the AnyBody Modeling System (select the menu Help->Demo). Under the Demo tab, you will find a link to extract the full repository. We recommend that you use this way to creating a local copy somewhere on your hard drive. In that case, you can make changes to some of the applications or even body models. The default path suggested during the demo installations is in your AnyBody application-data folder (typically `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\AnyBody Technology\AnyBody.##ANYBODY_v1##.x.x...`), but you can select it to be anywhere you prefer.

Please notice that demo files are NOT installed during the AnyBody installation because they must be available independently (not shared) for every user of the computer.

When you are working with the demo files, you can edit the files and thereby you may accidentally destroy the original demo models. Therefore, you can at any time reinstall the demos, either on top of the previous installation or in a different location if you want to preserve your changes and extensions.
