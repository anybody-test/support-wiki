This section is based this [Poster](http://wiki.anyscript.org/images/3/33/Dejong.pdf).

This study is part of the work done by ‘Team Icarus’ that is aiming to break the long distance record flying a Human Powered Aircraft. The aim of this study is to find an optimal recumbent position in combination with an optimal cadence using musculo-skeletal modelling and optimization algorithms.
